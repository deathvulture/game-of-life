# Conway's Game of Life

Welcome to my Conway's Game of Life!

## Introduction

It's a fun project that I started when I was feeling bored and wanted to challenge myself with a small coding project. This project not only helped me pass the time but also allowed me to learn new things along the way.

In this repository, you'll find my implementation of the Game of Life, along with any additional features or improvements I've added. My main goals for this project were:

1. Try new things and gain more experience with Javascript and HTML (Specially Canvas).
2. Understand the mechanics of Conway's Game of Life and how to implement it.
3. Experiment with different patterns and configurations to see how they evolve.

## About the Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game that involves a grid of cells that evolve over time based on a set of simple rules. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Game of Life, you can clone this repository to your local machine and serve the _src_ folder.
If you have node you can run.

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
